## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running locally.

### Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
Install Frontend Dependenciescd frontend
npm install
Environment VariablesCreate a .env file in the backend folder. Populate this file with the necessary configurations, such as API keys and database URIs.Running the ApplicationBackendTo start the backend server:cd backend
npm start
FrontendTo start the frontend development server:cd frontend
npm start
Accessing the ApplicationOnce both frontend and backend are running, visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view the application.Running TestsBackend TestsNavigate to the backend directory and run:npm test

See the LICENSE file for more details.AcknowledgmentsSpecial thanks to the following technologies and platforms:TensorFlow: For AI-powered features.React: For the front-end framework.Node.js: For backend development.MongoDB: For the database solution.Mentorship System Features (Conceptual)Here's a conceptual overview of how a mentorship system could be implemented within this project:1. Matching AlgorithmGoal: Connect mentees with suitable mentors.Mechanism: Implement an algorithm based on factors like skill levels, areas of expertise, and learning goals.Technology: Could leverage machine learning (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering) for recommendations.2. Live Video IntegrationGoal: Enable real-time communication between mentors and mentees.Technology: Integrate WebRTC directly into the browser for peer-to-peer video calls.3. Code Review FeatureGoal: Facilitate code feedback from mentors.Mechanism: Allow mentees to submit code (via file upload or snippets). Mentors can add comments and suggestions directly.Storage: Code snippets and comments could be stored in MongoDB.4. Progress TrackerGoal: Monitor mentee progress and learning journey.Mechanism: Use a database schema to track completed tasks, skills acquired, projects undertaken, and mentor feedback associated
